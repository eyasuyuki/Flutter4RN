# Why Flutter excitement me?

- Easy to install
- Dart2 is simple
- Very fast hot-reload
- Everything is Widget
- High productivity

---

# Easy to install

1. Download and extract Flutter SDK
2. Add ```flutter/bin``` to ```PATH``` environment
3. Use CLI command ```flutter doctor```
4. Install plugin to Android Studio/Visual Studio Code
5. Run iOS Simulator/Android emulator
6. ```flutter create -a kotlin -i swift <project_name>```
7. Update to new version ```flutter upgrade```

# Dart2 is simple

- Less *dark-side* than JS
- Everything is Object
- Class based object oriented language
- Strongly typed programming language
- ```this``` keyword refers current instance (like Java)
- Higher order function ```map, filter, fold```
- ```===``` operator was not supported (use ```identical```)
- ```==``` operator is appropriate
